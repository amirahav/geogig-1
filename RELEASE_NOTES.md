GeoGig 1.0-RC4 Release Notes
============================

December 19, 2016.

These are the release notes for the fourth GeoGig release candidate.

Five important things happended since 1.0-RC3 besides several bug fixes:

* First and foremost, the developer's team got three new memebers. Join us
to congratulate (and thank!) David Blasby, Morgan Thompson, and Alex Goudine
for becoming geogig committers and help us drive this project further and farther.

* We have cleared out all of our Intellectual Property checks on all our
dependencies and have now [LocationTech](https://locationtech.org/) blessing to perform
a sponsored release!
Thanks to LocationTech, Eclipse Foundation's geospatial branch, for their
continued support and commitment to the success of this and the other projects
under it's umbrella.

* The new RevTreeBuilder infrastructure became mainstream. It replaces the
legacy tree builder in order to generate revision trees faster, create no
garbage in the objects database (the old one left dangling tree objects
increasing the database size unnecessarily), and perhaps more importantly,
enables the use of the same infrastructure to build spatial and attribute
indexes on revision graphs (yes, you'll be able to index all your data 
history, stay tunned).

* The PosgreSQL storage backend is now WAL and replication safe, by moving
to use B-Tree indexes instead of Hash indexes. Thanks David Blasby for the
thorough performance testing. 

* The default storage backend for local repositories now uses [Rocksdb](http://rocksdb.org/).
It's faster than the old BerkeleyDB Java Edition database, and produces
smaller databases on disk.
The BerkeleyDB storage backend was taken off the official build, but Boundless
still provides a separate plugin download, so if you have existing repositories
just download [the bdbje plugin](https://github.com/locationtech/geogig/releases/download/v1.0-RC4/geogig-plugins-bdbje-1.0-RC4.zip) and unzip it
under your `<geogig installation directory>/lib/` folder.

We are really really close to a first 1.0 official release now! Maybe even for Christmas!

GeoGig 1.0-RC3 Release Notes
============================

August 4, 2016.

These are the release notes for the third GeoGig release candidate.

We have worked hard since RC2 on fixing the last outstanding bugs that prevented 
a solid release, and focused on some performance improvements.

This release is also the official launch of the PostgreSQL storage backend [1],
which allows to store several repositories in a single postgres database.

Also, the GeoServer plugin is being released for GeoServer 2.8, 2.9, and 2.10 series,
with several improvements both on GUI [2] and REST [3] configuration.

[2] <http://geogig.org/docs/interaction/geoserver_ui.html>
[3] <http://geogig.org/docs/interaction/geoserver_web-api.html>

The next steps are a strong focus on performance and scalability and a final
1.0 release by the end of the year. Stay tuned and write us back with your 
feedback about this important milestone.
