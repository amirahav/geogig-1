How to help
===========


Whether you can code or not, there are many ways in which you can contribute to the GeoGig project. Here are some ideas.


Communication
--------------

In all cases, communication with the GeoGig community and team is crucial, so make sure that you know the main ways to get in contact with other GeoGig users and developers.

Discussion takes place on our `GeoGig-devel mailing list <https://locationtech.org/mailman/listinfo/geogig-dev>`_. Please join and introduce yourself, we'd love to help, and to figure out ways for you to get involved.

There is also a GeoGig devel discussion channel on `gitter <https://gitter.im/locationtech/geogig>`_. GeoGig developers can usually be found there.

You can (and should) use the above for all GeoGig-related subjects, so other people are aware of your work with GeoGig and can help you and eventually handle your contributions to the project efficiently.


Testing
----------

If you are a user, testing is the best and most simple way of helping us improve GeoGig. Use GeoGig with your own datasets, and if you find something that can be improved or doesn't work as expected, `open a new issue <https://github.com/locationtech/geogig/issues/new>`_. Please, check first that the same problem has not been reported by another user, to avoid duplicated issues. 

Documenting
------------

You can also help us with the GeoGig documentation, improving it yourself, reporting errors/typos or pointing out areas where it could be improved. Documentation is handled in the same way as the GeoGig source code, using standard `GitHub workflows <https://help.github.com/categories/63/articles>`_. All GeoGig documentation is written using  ReStructuredText and can be found at https://github.com/locationtech/geogig/tree/master/doc/.


Developing
----------------

If you are a developer wanting to get involved, please, first read the `developers section <https://github.com/locationtech/geogig/blob/master/doc/technical/source/developers.rst>`_ for technical details about how to build and develop GeoGig.

If you want to contribute code to the project, you can do it using the GitHub *fork* and *pull request* workflow. The following are some things to take into account before sending a pull request.

- Include test case demonstrating functionality
- Contributions are expected to pass all tests and not break the build
- Include proper license headers on your contributed files

More information on this workflow and how to remotely collaborate in a project like GeoGig can be found at the `GitHub help page <https://help.github.com/categories/63/articles>`_

Issues to help out on are at our `issue tracker <https://github.com/locationtech/geogig/issues>`_.

In all cases, please let us know about your work in advance. Write to the GeoGig developers list or talk to someone on the IRC channel, so we can better coordinate all efforts.

Our build is `actively monitored using Jenkins <http://ares.boundlessgeo.com/jenkins/view/geogig/>`_.
